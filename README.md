# HELP PEOPLE GET JOBS
## Code challenge for Indeed

https://github.com/brandonkoopa/get-people-jobs

My solution to Indeed's code chellenge incorprates everything required for the "Senior Design Technologist" position, as well as some things mentioned in the interview.
- Animations
- React
- Webpack
- State management via Redux
- Responsive
- Scalability
- Custom events
- Following Indeed's design language

What this doesn't demonstrate, but what I like to include in other projects:
- Unit tests via Jest and integration tests via Cypress
- Styled-components for React, because CSS/SCSS was required and I wanted to play with Sass this time :-)

## How to play
